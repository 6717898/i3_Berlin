BdV = Bram de Vries


PRINTED PARTS
Design changes needed in the printed parts are:

X-Motor + X-Right	- The LM8UU click in too heavy. Reduce the click. 
			- The clamp should be openable for bearing exchange

X-Carriage	- no magnet slot: put it in

Y Front		- mounting hole should be the M4 mounting hole on the side and not the m3 PCB hole on the bottom

Y-Beltholder	- magnet support bumps into the power supply
		- no room for zipties to secure the belt; use a double set of teeth??

Y-Motor		- The belt tension causes unstraightness and probably squeeky sounds  

Power Supply	- Up side down?

Bottom Z	- bridge for the motor screw holes instead of tiny breakout supports (done 19-9 BdV)
		- The clamps for the rods need extra support for printing, now it´s a bit ugly (done 19-9 BdV)
		- The holder on the right needs a little slit for the Z endstop wire to go through


Fold Clamps	- they are in the way for the right z motor wire. 
		- nut slots are too loose

Ramps Casing	- is in the way for the mauly clamps to hold the mirror. The casing should move and/or redesigned

Bowden tube 	- would be nice to have a bowden to guide the filament. Can only work if the extruder part has some hole to keep the tube in place


M5 Tops		- They are a bit too low



MANUAL

Magnets		- on a screwdriver
Belts		- tension not to tight 
		- cut to only fit the teeth
