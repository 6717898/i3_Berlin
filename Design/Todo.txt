BdV = Bram de Vries


PRINTED PARTS
Design changes needed in the printed parts are:

Bottom Z	- bridge for the motor screw holes instead of tiny breakout supports (done 19-9 BdV)
		- The clamps for the rods need extra support for printing, now it´s a bit ugly (done 19-9 BdV)
		- The holder on the right needs a little slit for the Z endstop wire to go through

Y Front		- mounting hole should be the M4 mounting hole on the side and not the m3 PCB hole on the bottom
		- effectively this means that the powersupply, and the rest of the Y unit can be lowered another 6mm, let´s see how much work this is.

Fold Clamps	- they are in the way for the right z motor wire. 
		- nut slots are too loose

Ramps Casing	- is in the way for the mauly clamps to hold the mirror. The casing should move and/or redesigned

Bowden tube 	- would be nice to have a bowden to guide the filament. Can only work if the extruder part has some hole to keep the tube in place

X-Motor + X-Right	- The LM8UU click in too heavy. Reduce the click. 
			- The clamp should be openable for bearing exchange

Y-Beltholder	- magnet support bumps into the power supply
		- no room for zipties to secure the belt; use a double set of teeth??

M5 Tops		- They are a bit too low

Y-Motor		- The belt tension causes unstraightness and probably squeeky sounds
